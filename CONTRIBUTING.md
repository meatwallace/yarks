# :wrench: Contributing

:sparkles: Thanks for your interest in contributing! :sparkles:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing; they are not rules. Use
your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull
request.

## :speech_balloon: Code of Conduct

To ensure the project is kept open and inclusive, please read and follow the
[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## :clipboard: How can I contribute?

TODO

## :stars: Submitting a Pull Request

Pull requests are very welcome and appreciated, however they should remain
focused in scope, and a final submission should avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant changes, or if you are
uncertain if your changes are in line with the project's purpose.

## :construction: How do I set up my environment?

To make changes to the project, you will require Yarn >= v1.13 so that tooling
within the project works as expected.

To install Yarn, please see their official
[installation instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/). Once
installed, simply run `yarn` in the root of the repository to install the
project's dependencies.

## :bookmark_tabs: What do I need to know before submitting?

This project follows a strict
[commit message structure](https://github.com/meatwallace/yarks/commits/master).
You can ensure your commits adhere to this structure by using the interactive
[commitlint CLI](http://commitlint.js.org/) that is included in the repository.
After staging your files, simply run `yarn commit` and follow the prompt.

During the commit process, git hooks are used to automatically format relevant
files and catch syntax errors using [prettier](https://prettier.io) and
[eslint](https://eslint.org).

## :tada: Thankyou!
